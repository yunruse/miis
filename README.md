## How to match your very own Mii by eye alone

It's possible to recreate a Mii's face perfectly by eye by exploiting the fact you have two of them. This tactic is also useful in spot-the-differences, or playing games on the Dolphin Emulator in 3D without a headset.

  - Place the target Mii and edited Mii close together such that they have roughly the same size and vertical aligment.
  - Click the right stick, and cross your eyes until the images overlap.
  - The more accurate the Mii, the easier your eyes will 'snap' into place - they're fooled into thinking you're seeing 3D.
  - The differences will appear almost glitchy, so it is easy to modify most positions until they are correct.

I don't recommend matching colours by this method, but it's fun to mess with opposite colours to see 'impossible colours'.
